Hi, I'm Nick! I am a Machine Learning researcher from Irvine, California. I graduated summa cum laude and #1 in my class with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [California Baptist University](https://calbaptist.edu) in Spring 2023.
My research focuses on Multi-Modal Transfer Learning, which encompasses:
- Natural Language Processing / Understanding
- Computer Vision
- Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning
- Computational Cognitive Science
I am passionate about designing intelligent agents capable of perceiving and comprehending the world in ways similar to humans. My research revolves around constructing computational models and cognitive architectures that capture the intricacies of abstract cognition. I'm currently investigating the capability of few-shot learning and implicit learning of tokenized language to find complex patterns in noisy data.
